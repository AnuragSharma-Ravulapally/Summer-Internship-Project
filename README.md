# BINARY SEARCH AND BUBBLE SORT VISUALIZER
## Binary Search
Binary search is a method for finding specific values in sorted arrays by halving the search interval multiple times. This approach is faster than linear search for large datasets due to its O(log n) time complexity.
## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that iteratively compares neighboring entries, swapping them if out of order, until no further swaps are needed, despite being inefficient for large datasets.

I have learned a lot about front-end development and data structures and algorithms (DSA) thanks to this project. While working on this project, I was able to improve my skills in designing and optimizing user interfaces and to practically apply and strengthen my understanding of DSA ideas. The experience has improved my proficiency in both areas by increasing my theoretical knowledge and converting it into useful, real-world abilities.
